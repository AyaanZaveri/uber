## Why Swiftly?

One of the biggest problems with using Uber is the lack of integration with public transport networks. Users who use Uber as their last-mile service of choice have to use various route planning services to make trip decisions, which increase friction and often don't show Uber as an option. 

Swiftly solves this by providing transit planning, time and cost comparisons, all within the Uber app. This way, users can plan trips using both public transport and Uber within a single app. Swiftly's advantage is that it may be simply integrated into the Uber application under the existing transit tab. 

Swifly delivers on providing better last-mile connectivity to customers using transit, and encourages them to be more eco-friendly on long-distance routes to congested city centres.
